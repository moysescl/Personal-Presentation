# Personal-Presentation
Project developed during Internet Programming class

Project
Create a website presenting yourself.
1. You must present yourself professionally (with the kind of information you would put in a CV).
2. You must also present yourself in a more casual way: information about the city and the country where you were born, hobby, sports you like to practice or watch, leisure activities. 
Don’t disclose any information you would not disclose in a real page on Internet.
Don’t create two simple static pages connected by a link. Explore the resources in CSS3 and JavaScript to make the site more dynamic.
You are supposed to use HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript only. Your web site must be completely responsive (Desktop, Tablets and Smartphone).
You can choose your approach to responsiveness between “Desktop first” or “Mobile first”.
In this assign no wireframe or template will be provided, so you are supposed to take care of the “user experience” and the “graphical design”. 
Try to make the site as nice as possible. 
However you will not be penalize for poor UX or poor graphical design.
